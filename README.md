1x 16*2 LCD Screen
1x HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
1x LCD case
1x HC-SR04 Long Wall Hang

First  print HC-SR04 wall hang and 16*2 LCD case with a 3D printer 0.2 resolution and %20 infill.
Put HC-SR04 to wall hang and mount 200 cm height on a wall.
Cable HC-SR04 and LCD screen to Arduino Uno
Mount LCD screen case 
Upload code to Arduino
For best measure use a piece of thin cardboard.
